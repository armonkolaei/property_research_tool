            <h2>Refinance + Cash Purchase</h2>
            <p>Analyze the following property for investment potential. I plan to keep my primary residence and refinance it to purchase the second property outright with no new mortgage. I want to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the expected rent for the new property?</li>
                <li>Will that rent cover all monthly expenses for the new property (e.g., taxes, maintenance)?</li>
                <li>If rent exceeds expenses, how much can go toward reducing my refinanced monthly mortgage on my primary residence?</li>
                <li>Or will this investment result in a monthly deficit?</li>
                <li>Also, clearly calculate how much additional cash I need to provide out-of-pocket to cover the difference between the refinance funds and the property purchase price.</li>
            </ul>
